# AVBVD Trading Strategy - Adaptive Volatility Breakout with Volume Divergence

## Educational Disclaimer

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️**

This backtesting system is designed as an educational project to demonstrate Level 3 Programming concepts where English prompts generate functional code. This is NOT intended for real trading.

- Even the best hedge funds struggle to consistently beat markets
- Past performance does NOT guarantee future results
- This demonstrates programming concepts, NOT viable trading strategies
- DO NOT use this system for actual trading or investment decisions

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive stock trading backtesting system that tests the "Adaptive Volatility Breakout with Volume Divergence (AVBVD)" strategy across 25 years of S&P 500 stock data (2000-2024).

### Key Features

1. **Single-Threaded Trading Model**: Only holds ONE position at a time
2. **Multi-Year Backtesting**: Processes each year separately (2000-2024)
3. **Four Unique Strategy Components**:
   - Dynamic Volatility Channels
   - Volume-Price Momentum Divergence
   - Gap Sentiment Analysis
   - Intraday Range Efficiency
4. **Comprehensive Risk Management**: Stop-loss, take-profit, holding periods
5. **Detailed Outputs**: CSV files, Excel workbooks, and visualization charts

## Strategy Components

### Component A: Dynamic Volatility Channels (30% weight)

Measures the expansion and contraction of market volatility:

- **True Range**: `max(High-Low, abs(High-PrevClose), abs(Low-PrevClose))`
- **Average True Range (ATR)**: Rolling average over 20 days
- **Expansion Ratio**: `TrueRange / ATR`
- **Volatility Channels**: Price bands at `Close ± (ATR × 2.0)`
- **Channel Position**: Where current price sits within the channel (0-1 scale)

**Trading Logic**:
- Expanding volatility (ratio > 1.8) suggests potential breakout opportunities
- Contracting volatility suggests consolidation or trend exhaustion

### Component B: Volume-Price Momentum Divergence (30% weight)

Detects institutional "smart money" flows:

- **Volume Velocity**: Percent change in volume over 10 days
- **Price Momentum**: Percent change in price over same period
- **Volume Acceleration**: Rate of change of volume velocity

**Trading Logic**:
- **ACCUMULATION** (bullish): Volume increasing (+25%) while price flat/down - institutions buying
- **DISTRIBUTION** (bearish): Volume decreasing (-25%) while price up - institutions selling

### Component C: Gap Sentiment Analysis (30% weight)

Analyzes overnight price gaps and their behavior:

- **Overnight Gap**: `(Open - Previous Close) / Previous Close`
- **Gap Fill Ratio**: How much the gap filled during the day
- **Gap Momentum Score**: Weighted average of recent gaps (recent = higher weight)

**Trading Logic**:
- **Gap Extension**: Gap continues same direction (ratio > 0.4) - strong momentum
- **Gap Reversal**: Gap fills and reverses (ratio < -0.4) - rejection of move
- **Gap Momentum**: Trend of gaps over 5 days indicates market sentiment

### Component D: Intraday Range Efficiency (30% weight)

Measures the "quality" of price movements:

- **Daily Range**: `High - Low`
- **Directional Move**: `abs(Close - Open)`
- **Range Efficiency**: `Directional Move / Daily Range` (0 to 1)
- **Average Efficiency**: 3-day rolling average

**Trading Logic**:
- **High Efficiency** (>0.65): Trending, directional moves - follow momentum
- **Low Efficiency** (<0.65): Choppy, non-directional - avoid or exit

## Signal Generation

### BUY SIGNALS (Require at least 3 of 5 conditions)

1. ✅ Volatility expanding (expansion ratio > 1.8)
2. ✅ Accumulation detected (volume up, price flat/down)
3. ✅ Positive gap momentum WITH gap extension
4. ✅ High efficiency (>0.65) AND efficiency increasing
5. ✅ Price in lower 25% of volatility channel (good entry point)

### SELL SIGNALS (Require at least 3 of 5 conditions)

1. ✅ Volatility contracting
2. ✅ Distribution detected (volume down, price up)
3. ✅ Negative gap momentum OR gap reversal
4. ✅ Low efficiency OR efficiency decreasing
5. ✅ Price in upper 25% of volatility channel (take profit zone)

## Risk Management

The system implements multiple risk management layers:

1. **Stop Loss**: Exit if position down -8%
2. **Take Profit**: Exit if position up +15%
3. **Minimum Holding Period**: 5 days before allowing sell signal exit
4. **Maximum Holding Period**: 30 days - force exit
5. **Transaction Costs**: 0.1% on both buy and sell

## Position Sizing

Three methods available (configured via `POSITION_SIZE_METHOD`):

1. **Equal Weight** (default): 20% of portfolio per position
2. **Volatility Adjusted**: Inverse volatility weighting (higher vol = smaller position)
3. **All-In**: Invest all available cash

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Stock data CSV files in `stocks/` folder

### Setup

1. **Clone or download this project**

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure stock data is available**:
   - Place CSV files in `stocks/` folder
   - CSV format: `Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Ticker`
   - Data should span 2000-2024

## Usage

### Running the Backtest

Simply run the main Python file:

```bash
python avbvd_trading_strategy.py
```

The system will:
1. Load all stock data from `stocks/` folder
2. Process each year from 2000-2024 separately
3. Generate outputs for each year
4. Create a summary comparison across all years

### Execution Flow

For each year:
1. Initialize fresh portfolio with $100 starting capital
2. Process all stocks sequentially (single-threaded)
3. Apply strategy indicators and generate signals
4. Execute trades (only when no position held)
5. Apply risk management rules
6. Close any open position at year end
7. Generate outputs: CSV, Excel, charts

### Expected Runtime

- Processing 500+ stocks across 25 years
- Approximately 5-15 minutes depending on system
- Progress updates displayed every 20 days processed

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Missing Data**: Stocks with insufficient data are skipped with warnings
- **Division by Zero**: All calculations handle zero denominators gracefully
- **Individual Stock Failures**: Continues processing if one stock fails
- **Missing Files**: Clear error messages if stocks folder not found

## Troubleshooting

### "ERROR: Stocks folder 'stocks/' not found!"
- Ensure the `stocks/` folder exists in the same directory as the script
- Check folder name spelling (case-sensitive on some systems)

### "No CSV files found in 'stocks/' folder!"
- Verify CSV files are placed in the `stocks/` folder
- Check file extensions are `.csv`

### "Warning: Skipping [filename] - missing required columns"
- Verify CSV files have all required columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- Check column name spelling and capitalization

### Charts not generating
- Ensure matplotlib is installed correctly
- Check that trades were executed (no trades = no charts)
- Verify write permissions for output folder

## Performance Optimization

For faster processing:

1. **Reduce chart generation**: Set `MAX_CHARTS_PER_YEAR` to a lower value (e.g., 10)
2. **Process fewer years**: Modify the year range in `run_multi_year_backtest()`
3. **Skip chart generation**: Comment out the `generate_charts()` call
4. **Use fewer stocks**: Reduce the number of CSV files in `stocks/` folder
